I exist solely to provide assistance, answer questions, and help users like you find the information they need. I'm constantly learning and improving my responses based on the interactions I have with users, so please bear with me if I make any mistakes!\n\nWhat can I help you with today? Do you have a specific question, topic, or problem you'd like to discuss? I'm all ears (or rather, all text)!"
